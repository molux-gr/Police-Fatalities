# Police-Fatalities
Individuals killed by police in the US from 2000 - 2016
This dataset aims to provide insight into individuals who were killed during alteractions with police. It includes information on their age, race, mental health status, weapons they were armed with, and if they were fleeing.
Now and then we are hearing from the news or reading on the internet the news about the fatal shootings by police in U.S. There is little doubt that in most of the cases the shootings are justified as the law forces are dealing with the dangerous situations and criminal offenders who otherwise can cause severe damage to the innocent public, but now and then we hear social concerns about the racial bias that continue when dealing with the fatalities of the potential offenders. The concerns are getting amplified when we hear that there are cases where police kill people who were originally unarmed. In all of the U.S. states, I want to find if such concerns are valid..
The questions that will be answered are:
1. What is the trend of the police shootings in the last 17 years (is there increase or decrease in a certain year)
2. Months with the most fatalities
3. Find which Age groups are subject to most or least of the police shootings.
4. Find if certain ethnic groups have a larger risk of being shot while not being armed.
5. Find if there is a racial bias (if certain ethnic groups are being killed more than the others)
6. The mean age of people affected for each state
7. Top 10 state with the most fatalities
7a. Top 10 cities with the most fatalities
8. check victims mental statusÂ¶
8b. The most ethnic group wich suffer mental illness
